# Pothole Detection 🚗💥

This project uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** 🧠 for detecting potholes in road surfaces using computer vision. The model analyzes images and videos to identify potholes, helping improve road safety 🚧, support infrastructure maintenance 🛠️, and enhance autonomous vehicle navigation 🚙.

## Features ✨

- **Real-time pothole detection** on images and video streams 🎥📸.
- **Pretrained YOLO models** (YOLOv5, YOLOv8) for accurate and fast pothole detection ⚡.
- **Custom pothole detection dataset** built from real-world images to ensure diverse conditions 🛣️

## Technologies 💻

- **Languages**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
    - **OpenCV** (`cv2`): For image processing and video stream analysis 🎥.
    - **PyTorch** (`torch`): Deep learning framework used for training and inference 💻.
    - **ElementTree** (`xml.etree.ElementTree`): For parsing XML data 📑.
    - **YAML**: For handling configuration files 📄.
    - **OS** and **Shutil**: For file and directory manipulation ⚙️.
  
  The core object detection is done using **YOLO** (v5, v8) 🔍.

- **Notebook**: The main work is done in the Jupyter Notebook: [Potholes_image_Detection.ipynb](Potholes_image_Detection.ipynb)

## Installation ⚙️
